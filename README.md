BigBrainSym template is the BigBrain registered to MNI2009bSym space

Detailed description:

BigBrain is an ultra-high resolution histological 3D model of the brain created using a large-scale microtome to cut a complete paraffin-embedded brain (65-year-old male) coronally at 20-mm thickness. The BigBrainSym template refers to the BigBrain registered to MNI2009bSym space, as defined in previous studies.

Please refer to the project page for more details: http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/?p=1209

The warped atlases and segmentation labels (not the spatial transformations in MINC format) have also been deposited at OpenNeuro.org in BIDS format: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002016/versions/1.0.0
